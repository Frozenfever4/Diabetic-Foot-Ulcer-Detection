# Diabetic-Foot-Ulcer-Detection using U-Net, U-Net++, and SegNet (an Ensemble Approach)

Welcome to the repository for Foot Ulcer Segmentation! This project aims to accurately identify and segment foot ulcers from medical images using deep learning techniques. We leverage three different models — U-Net, U-Net++, and SegNet — and enhance the input data using wavelet transform. The final segmentation output is generated by averaging the predictions of all three models for improved accuracy.

# Project Goals
**Ulcer Segmentation:** Precisely detect and segment foot ulcers in medical images using U-Net, U-Net++, and SegNet architectures.

**Image Enhancement:** Apply wavelet transform to improve input image quality and highlight important features before feeding them into the models.

**Ensemble Prediction:** Boost segmentation performance by averaging the outputs from all three models, ensuring more stable and accurate results.

# Models Implemented
**U-Net:** A popular CNN architecture tailored for biomedical image segmentation.

**U-Net++:** An enhanced variant of U-Net featuring nested and dense skip connections, offering improved precision.

**SegNet:** A deep encoder-decoder network designed for semantic segmentation tasks.

# Preprocessing Technique
**Wavelet Transform:** Utilized to break down images into various frequency components, enabling better feature extraction and noise reduction during preprocessing.
